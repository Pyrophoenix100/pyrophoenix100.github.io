# The Website

## Why
The short answer is that I wanted a website to show off some of my personal projects and act as a sort of hub for anything that I make and want to show off. The long answer is that there is a lot of "Why"'s behind this website. The big "Why" behind this project is why I decided to do it in the most unintuitive way possible. For all of my projects, I seek to find a skill or paradigm that I can base a project around. For this project, I wanted to focus on reinventing the wheel to get a incredibly fast loading site, so that I can see why we have modular code nowadays, and why the JS package ecosystem isn't as bad as I think it is. Quite a few of my previous projects have been mash-ups of different libraries, with chunks of my code in random places. This project would be (almost) all my work, all in one place, and would take no server side processing (My reasoning was that I didn't think server-side processing was necessary for what was going to be a static site).
