# Spicy McCrispy Sandwich
## Recipe
### The Sandwich Itself
| Ingredient           | Amount      |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Spicy Chicken Sauce  | 6 servings  |
| Chicken breasts      | 3           |
| Corn Starch          | 1 Cup       |
| Flour                | 2 Cups      |
| Garlic Powder        | 1 Tbsp      |
| Cayenne Powder       | 1 Tbsp      |
| Onion Powder         | 1 Tbsp      |
| Buttermilk           | 2 Cups      |
| Buns (Pref. Sesame)  | 6 buns      |
Makes: 6 servings
Takes: 2-8 hours
1. Prepare chicken breasts by tenderising them down to 1" thick breasts, then slice diagonally for a teardrop shape. Cutlets should be able to fit nicely within whatever buns you have.
2. Season chicken well, with garlic powder, cayenne powder, onion powder. and whatever else you feel fits. Go wild.
3. Add the cutlets and buttermilk to a mixing bowl, wrap and refrigerate for 2-8 hours. 
4. Heat oil in a pan to medium, take the cutlets out of the refrigerator, and add Corn Starch and flour to another bowl. You can add spices to this too, but it takes quite a bit to get any effect.
5. Coat the chicken in the flour mixture, and optionally dip it in the buttermilk again and the flour mixture for a thicker coating.
6. Fry chicken until outside is golden brown and the inside is fully cooked. When you remove the chicken, put in on a paper towel, and dry off excess oil.
7. Toast the buns and make the sauce, assemble as desired.
8. Recommend serving with fries or pickles.
### The Delicious Sauce

| Lemon Juice        | 1 Tsp       |
| Mustard            | 1 1/2 Tbsp  |

| Cayenne Pepper     | To Taste    |
Makes: 2 servings

* Mix ingredients together well, adjust flavor as wanted. Oil (preferably soybean) can be used to make the sauce thinner if desired.
## Reasoning
I wanted to do this for a while, or at least try to copy some restaurant's recipe to see how hard it would be to get it exact. I've liked these sandwiches since they came out, and the habenero spice on an otherwise regular fast food fried chicken breast is a very nice touch that would be cool to try to copy. And then the clown came out with this ad:

and I took that personally

At this point, they're just taunting me to do it better than them. So I just made some simple changes. It works much better with sesame buns, and a little bit of sriracha to sweeten up the sauce a bit. Other than that, it's a pretty damn good sandwich. With my recipe, you can get the most out of your chicken breasts by soaking them in buttermilk to get really juicy sandwiches; just make sure to cook them until there's no more buttermilk running out.
